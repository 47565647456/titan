# Titan.ServiceDefaults

## Overview
**Titan.ServiceDefaults** is a shared utility project generated by .NET Aspire. It contains extension methods that establish a baseline configuration for all services in the Titan distributed application.

## Role in Global Solution
This project ensures consistency across all microservices (API and Silos). Instead of duplicating setup code for logging, metrics, and health checks in every `Program.cs`, each service simply calls `builder.AddServiceDefaults()`.

## Key Responsibilities
- **OpenTelemetry Config**: Sets up tracing, metrics, and logging exporters to send data to the Aspire Dashboard.
- **Resilience**: Applies standard .NET resilience policies (retries, circuit breakers) to all outgoing HTTP clients by default.
- **Health Checks**: Configures standard health check endpoints (`/health`, `/alive`).
- **Service Discovery**: Configures HttpClient default behavior for discovering other services.
